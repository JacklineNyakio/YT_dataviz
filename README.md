This is a Data visualisation tool, I presented at PyConKE on 28th September 2017 at USIU-Africa. I make use of Jupyter notebooks, Python, Pandas, Bokeh to make a multipurpose data visualisation tool that addresses the limitations i've seen in other alternatives according to the presentation i gave.
