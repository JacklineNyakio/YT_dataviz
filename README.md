# YT_dataviz
This is a Data visualisation tool, I presented at PyConKE on 28th September 2017 at USIU-Africa. I make use of Jupyter notebooks, Python, Pandas, Bokeh to make a multipurpose data visualisation tool that addresses the limitations i've seen in other alternatives according to the presentation i gave.

Use this to install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then go through the codebook.txt and the slides(PyCon-presentation.odp - Use LibreOffice).


Afterwards, you can run the notebook:

`jupyter notebook Data_visualisation_tool_YT.ipynb`
