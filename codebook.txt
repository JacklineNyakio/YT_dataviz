Description:

The datasets available will be YouTube data collected for the channel Sliceace; It is about
on extreme sports like paintball and skateboarding. The other is channel about gaming and
vlogs among other things. This is how the data was collected from YouTube since i'm 
assuming the reader is interested in trying out the tool for themselves/their own channels.

https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ib6haDXJqMC6Sgfk1 - this is a photo album that will show you 
how to get your data. 

In addition, the other channel we are using for comparison is monetised meaning that the 
content creator gets money out of their channel. 


Format:
A Dataframe with 573 rows and 41 columns for the channel sliceace
A Dataframe with 1526 rows and 54 columns for a channel 


Variables:

These are the number of columns in the dataset. Notice they are different for the two 
channels. I'll try to explain what they mean to the best of my ability. At first glance, 
they look straightforward but right now. I'm already facing challenges since i'm not 
sure what some mean i.e the variables.

* watch_time_minutes: time in minutes people spend watching your videos. Big numbers good
small numbers bad.

* views : How unique people have discovered your channel and probably looked at the 
content like introductory video. P.s my channel doesn't have one. :)

* average_view_duration: The mean views of the previous variable.

* average_percentage_viewed: views as a percentage
 
* card_clicks: The "i" icon usually at the top right of videos. How many people have clicked
it.

* cards_shown: How many of those cards were seen in your video.

* clicks_per_card_shown: clicks each card gets from different viewers.

* card_teaser_clicks: clicks the card get as soon as the text along with the "i" icon is 
displayed to viewer.

* card_teasers_shown: how many viewers have made it till the card text in the "i" is 
shown.

* clicks_per_card_teaser_shown: number of times the card has been clicked for different 
videos as soon as the "i" icon and text appears.

* end_screen_elements_shown: end screen elements are the subscribe icon seen at the end
of the video, it could be a playlist or playlist. So this is how many that were seen by 
the viewer of the video who've watched the video until the end or till when the element 
is shown.

* end_screen_element_clicks: number of times the viewers have clicked your screen elements.

* clicks_per_end_screen_element_shown: How much each end screen element per video has been
clicked.

* annotation_clicks: I looked at a wikihow post to remember what annotations are here: 
https://www.wikihow.com/Add-Annotations-to-a-YouTube-Video. So how many times your 
"Add Speech Bubble", "Add Spotlight","Label", "Title" or "Add Note" were clicked.
