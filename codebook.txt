Description:

The datasets available will be YouTube data collected for the channel Sliceace; It is about
on extreme sports like paintball and skateboarding. The other is channel about gaming and
vlogs among other things. This is how the data was collected from YouTube since i'm 
assuming the reader is interested in trying out the tool for themselves/their own channels.

how to get your data. 

In addition, the other channel we are using for comparison is monetised meaning that the 
content creator gets money out of their channel.

A Dataframe with 1526 rows and 54 columns for a channel 


Variables:
