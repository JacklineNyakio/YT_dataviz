Description:

The datasets available will be YouTube data collected for the channel Sliceace; It is about
on extreme sports like paintball and skateboarding. The other is channel about gaming and
vlogs among other things. This is how the data was collected from YouTube since i'm 
assuming the reader is interested in trying out the tool for themselves/their own channels.

https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ib6haDXJqMC6Sgfk1 - this is a photo album that will show you 
how to get your data. 

In addition, the other channel we are using for comparison is monetised meaning that the 
content creator gets money out of their channel. 


Format:
A Dataframe with 573 rows and 41 columns for the channel sliceace
A Dataframe with 1526 rows and 54 columns for a channel 


Variables:

These are the number of columns in the dataset. Notice they are different for the two 
channels. I'll try to explain what they mean to the best of my ability. At first glance, 
they look straightforward but right now. I'm already facing challenges since i'm not 
sure what some mean i.e the variables.

* watch_time_minutes: time in minutes people spend watching your videos.
* views : How unique people have discovered your channel and probably looked at the 
content like introductory video. P.s my channel doesn't have one. :)
